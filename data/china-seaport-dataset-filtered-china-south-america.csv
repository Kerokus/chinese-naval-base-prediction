China’s Ministry of Commerce was the source of funding and it committed RMB 159 million in total. Phase 1 of the Alto do Bandim Fishing Port Project was financed by the African Development Bank with US$4 million and it included the construction of a pier, a fish auction and an administrative building. Phase 2 involved the construction of a 50-meter-long floating dock, new breakwaters, administrative and fishery trade buildings, connecting roads, and drainage and sewage pipe networks within a 300-meter area.  China Railway Guangzhou Engineering Group Corporation (CRGEG) was the contractor responsible for implementation. On October 31, 2018, a foundation stone laying ceremony took place. Then, on March 22, 2019, Guinea-Bissau’s Minister of Fisheries, Adiatu Djaló Nandigna, announced that Phase 2 would be completed in the next two years. However, project implementation was temporarily halted in the spring of 2020 due to the COVID-19 epidemic. Work resumed on July 15, 2020.

(2014) 43 TOTAL NO. (337)] for the Abidjan Autonomous Port Expansion and Modernization Project. The proceeds of the loan were then on-lent to the Abidjan Autonomous Port Authority (PAA). The borrowing terms of the PBC were as follows: a 20-year maturity, a 7-year grace period, and a 2% interest rate. The borrower was also required to maintain a minimum cash balance of CFA 3 billion in an escrow account (accessible to the lender).The proceeds of the PBC were used to be used by the borrower to finance 85% of the cost of a $933.4 million EPC contract between Abidjan Autonomous Port Authority (PAA) and China Harbour Engineering Co., Ltd. (CHEC), which was signed on January 11, 2013. The Government of Cote d'Ivoire was responsible for financing the remaining 15% of the commercial contract cost ($140,010,000). African Export-Import Bank (Afreximbank) also arranged an EUR 250 million syndicated bridge loan facility in 2014 for this project.According to the Government of Côte d'Ivoire’s Aid Management Platform (AMP), China Eximbank made 15 loan disbursements (worth CFA 459,375,056,353) between 2015 and 2020: a CFA 71,405,100,000 disbursement on September 30, 2015, a CFA 48,843,381,789 disbursement on April 30, 2016, a CFA 5,293,017,891 disbursement on June 30, 2016, a CFA 8,388,694,167 disbursement on October 31, 2016, a CFA 3,281,002,542 disbursement on November 30, 2016, a CFA 50,318,912,478 disbursement on December 31, 2016, a CFA 60,326,378,065 disbursement on December 31, 2017, a CFA 75,857,838,185 disbursement on October 31, 2018, a CFA 24,960,426,152 disbursement on May 31, 2019, a CFA 6,247,765,605 disbursement on September 30, 2019, a CFA 17,886,499,596 disbursement on October 31, 2019, a CFA 12,392,163,528 disbursement on December 31, 2019, a CFA 7,423,281,737 disbursement on March 31, 2020, a CFA 5,517,839,600 disbursement on April 30, 2010, and a CFA 61,232,755,018 disbursement on June 30, 2020.The project involved the enlargement of the Vridi canal (a link from Abidjan to the Atlantic Ocean), the construction of a second container terminal, and a roll-on/roll-off terminal. It was expected to start in the first quarter of 2015 and reach completion by 2021. CHEC was the EPC contractor responsible for implementation. A groundbreaking ceremony took place on October 6, 2015. The roll-on/roll-off terminal was finished at some point in 2018. On February 21, 2019, the enlargement of Vridi Canal was officially completed and handed over to the Government of Cote d'Ivoire. The project as a whole was officially completed on April 23, 2020, and a certificate of final acceptance was issued by the project owner in July 2021. However, the construction of the second container terminal was not completed until November 25, 2022. The modern container terminal, roll-on/roll-off terminal, jetties, and approach channels that were expanded and improved with financing from China Eximbank have reportedly increased the cargo handling capacity and efficiency of the port.This project suffered from major cash flow problems. According to the Government of Côte d'Ivoire’s Aid Management Platform (AMP), PAA had payment arrears to CHEC worth CFA 186 billion (China Eximbank share: CFA 165 billion; PAA share: CFA 21 billion) as of November 14, 2017. The AMP also notes that, as of November 14, 2017, the project was generating large financial outflows but it was not expected to generate revenue until 2020. To increase PAA’s revenue-generation capacity, the Ivorian authorities considered putting in place a special tax and customs regime (in accordance with Articles 4 and 43 of the PAA statutes) from 2020 to 2035. It is unclear if they ultimately did so. The Government of Cote d'Ivoire and PAA also secured an EUR 10,641,840 agreement with Matha Capital, JP Morgan, Société Générale Paris, and Ecobank to hedge its foreign exchange (USD/CFA) risk on its outstanding debt to China Eximbank for the Abidjan Autonomous Port Expansion and Modernization Project.",Completion,Mixed,Loan (excluding debt rescheduling),Yes,OOF-like,Export-Import Bank of China (China Eximbank),African Export-Import Bank (Afreximbank)|Bolloré Group|Ecobank|JPMorgan Chase & Co.|Matha Capital|Société Générale S.A.

The borrowing terms of the PBC were as follows: a 2% interest rate, a 7 year grace period, a 20 year maturity, a 0.3% commitment fee, and a 0.3% management fee. The borrower agreed to deposit project-related revenues in a revenue account to facilitate repayment. The proceeds of the PBC were to be used by the borrower to finance 85% of the total cost ($497,468,255) of a commercial contract between China Harbour Engineering Company Limited and Cameroon's Ministry of Economy. The Republic of Cameroon originally agreed to cover the remaining 15% of the project cost, but it later renegotiated and reportedly did not pay for this component of the project. As of December 31, 2020, the loan (PBC) had achieved a 100% disbursement rate. The loan’s outstanding amount was equivalent to CFA 191.5 billion as of December 31, 2020.  The purpose of the project was undertake the first phase of the construct of a deep seaport in the Atlantic coast town of Kribi, 300 km south of Yaounde. Upon completion, the main port was expected to receive large vessels with a capacity close to 100,000 tons.  Construction began on January 10, 2010, and an official groundbreaking ceremony took place on October 8, 2011. The project was completed on April 6, 2015. Project ID#350 captures the China Eximbank PBC for Phase 1 of the Kribi Deep Sea Port Project. China Eximbank also provided financing for Phase 2 of the Kribi Deep Sea Port Project via a GCL (as captured via Project ID#53116) as well as a PBC (as captured via Project ID#53396). Phase 2 of the Kribi Deep Sea Port Project was completed on March 2, 2018.  Following a call for tenders, the right to manage the container terminal of the port was awarded to a consortium made up of CHEC and two French companies, Bolloré and CMA CGM, while the right to operate the multipurpose terminal went to the consortium of the French Necotrans and the Cameroonian Kribi Port Multi Operators (KPMO).There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan for the first and second phases of the Kribi Deep Sea Port Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. In January 2019, Cameroon unilaterally withheld debt service payments to China Eximbank. The lender responded by withholding new loan disbursements. Then, in July 2019, China Eximbank and the Government of Cameroon signed a debt rescheduling agreement (as captured via Project ID#88213). Under the terms of the agreement, China Eximbank agreed to reschedule 18 loans previously contracted by the Government of Cameroon — with scheduled principal repayments between July 2019 and March 2022 — by allowing the borrower to defer scheduled principal repayments between July 2019 and March 2022 to later dates but without any maturity extensions. The total amount of restructured debt was equivalent CFA 148 billion ($253 million) — or 70% of the loan principal that was scheduled for repayment between July 2019 and March 2022. Under the terms of the agreement, the Government of Cameroon agreed to repay 30% of the loan principal according to the original July 2019-March 2022 schedule (i.e. without any payment deferrals). The lender and the borrower also agreed to cancel the committed but undisbursed loan balances worth approximately CFA 10 billion (for certain loans with disbursement deadlines that had already passed). Then, in January 2020, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) classified the Government Cameroon as facing a high risk of debt distress. Eighteen months later, during an address before Cameroon’s National Assembly on June 28, 2021, the Minister of Water and Energy (MINEE) Gaston Eloundou Esommba provided an update on the ICBC-financed Bini à Warak Hydroelectric Power Plant Project. He noted that the project had been 'on hold' since November 2019 because ICBC suspended the loan agreement, even though the Government of Cameroon had already mobilized XAF 22 billion of counterpart funding.

Then, on November 15, 2014, the Government of Mozambique ratified this loan agreement. The loan carries the following borrowing terms: a 2% interest rate, a 7 year grace period, and a 20 year maturity. This project involved the construction of a dock that is 377 meters long (compared with 188 meters previously) in order to allow 16 industrial vessels to be moored simultaneously. It also involved the installation of six cold stores, an ice factory with a capacity of 60 tonnes per day, a fish processing room with a capacity of 50 tonnes per day, and a handling capacity of 700,000 tons per year. Beira’s fishing port was destroyed by cyclone Eline, which struck the provincial capital of Sofala in February 2000. China Harbor Engineering Company (CHEC) was the contractor responsible for implementation. A groundbreaking ceremony took place on June 27, 2016 and the project was officially completed and handed over to the authorities in Mozambique on October 28, 2019.There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan for the Beira Fishing Port Rehabilitation Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. In 2016, several credit rating agencies downgraded the Government of Mozambique to 'selective default' or 'restricted default' status, and the World Bank and the IMF re-classified Mozambique's external debt as 'in distress.' In January 2017, the Government of Mozambique defaulted on a coupon payment for its dollar-denominated Eurobond. Then, in February 2018, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) announced that the Government of Mozambique had accumulated $710 million in arrears to external creditors and had agreed to reschedule some bilateral debt service payments with the Chinese Government. Two months later, in April 2018, Stelia Neta, a National Director at the Ministry of Finance of Mozambique revealed that the Government of Mozambique’s outstanding debt obligations to the Chinese Government amounted to $2.02 billion and the Chinese Government had agreed to extend the grace periods (and first principal repayments) on these outstanding debt obligations without changing their final maturity dates or interest rates (as captured via Project ID#66283).",Completion,Development,Loan (excluding debt rescheduling),Yes,ODA-like,Export-Import Bank of China (China Eximbank),,Government of Mozambique,"China Harbour Engineering Co., Ltd.",,132824857.5,-19.816415,34.8368554,https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/172425131,precise

This loan will reportedly be issued as a subsidiary loan agreement under the $20 billion Resource and Loan Cooperation Framework Agreement that the Chinese Government and the Republic of Guinea signed on September 5, 2017 (see Project ID#65113 and Project ID#64352). As such, it will carry the following terms: 15-year maturity, 4 year grace period, and an interest rate of 6-month Euribor plus a 2.5% margin. The proceeds of the loan will be used to fund 85% of the cost of a $774 million (nearly €650 million) EPC contract with China Harbour Engineering Co (CHEC).

The PBC (captured via Project ID#59375) carries the following borrowing terms: a 20-year maturity, a 7-year grace period, a 2% interest rate, a 0.25% commitment fee, and a 0.50% management fee. The Djiboutian legislature ratified the PBC agreement on June 7, 2016. According to Djibouti’s Ministry of Economy, Finance, and Industry, the PBC (loan) ultimately achieved a 89.2% disbursement rate (FDJ 54,594,000,000). The proceeds of the PBC were to be used by the borrower to partially finance a commercial contract (No. PDSA-GHDC-01) worth $476,779,000.42 that was signed by China State Construction Engineering Corporation (CSCEC), China Civil Engineering Construction Corporation (CCECC), and Port of Djibouti S.A. (PDSA) on August 16, 2014. PDSA is a joint venture between the Government of Dijbouti (76.5% equity stake) and China Merchants Group (23.5% equity stake). PDSA was responsible for the remainder ($132,306,173.17) of the commercial contract cost. In 2016, PDSA also obtained a $50 million loan (captured via Project ID#91872 from the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) for the Doraleh Multipurpose Port Project. The Government of Djibouti issued a sovereign guarantee in support of the ICBC loan on May 3, 2016. The objective of the Doraleh Multipurpose Port (DMP) was to relieve pressure on the Port of Djibouti SA as the pace of trade between Africa and the rest of the world increased. More specifically, the DMP project component was designed to expand the existing port's capacity by adding seven new berths in the first phase, including a roll on/roll off facility, with a total length of 1,200 meters. Each berth was meant to accommodate ships with cargoes of up to 100,000 tons in a naturally deep-water bay that will require minimal dredging. Upon completion, the designed annual throughput of bulk cargo volume and the container volume were to be 7.08 million tons and 200,000 TEU, respectively. The livestock port at Damerjog, located in the Arta region 13 km south-east of the capital, was meant to comprise a quay 655 meters long for up to five ships and a holding area for 150,000 head of livestock. The ultimate objective of this component of the project was to create a livestock port with an anticipated capacity of 10 million heads of livestock per year that could export livestock from Ethiopia and South Sudan to the Gulf countries and North Africa. CCECC and CSCEC were the contractors responsible for project implementation.  A foundation stone laying ceremony took place on September 8, 2013. However, construction at the DMP did not begin until August 2014. Construction at the livestock port at Damerjog commenced on October 26, 2014. Construction activities ended in February 2017. The DMP was formally inaugurated on May 24, 2017 and then put into use in July 2018. This project has been plagued by controversy. In 2004, DP World acquired a 33.4-percent stake in the Doraleh Container Terminal SA (DCT). Then, on October 30, 2006, the Republic of Djibouti, DCT and Dubai International (Djibouti) FZE signed a concession agreement that granted Dubai International (Djibouti) FZE — a subsidiary of DP World — the exclusive right to design, build and manage the terminal. DCT commenced operations on December 15, 2008 (though it was formally inaugurated on February 7, 2009) as the first deep-water terminal in Africa that could permit ships of 15,000 TEU to dock alongside. However, the relationship between DP World and the Republic of Djibouti eventually deteriorated and the Republic of Djibouti initiated discussions with China about the possibility of developing a greenfield multi-purpose port adjacent to DCT. In early 2013, China Merchants Group and its affiliates agreed with Djibouti to develop, build, and operate a new multipurpose port, bulk terminal, crude oil terminal and ship repair yard in order to transform the old port of Djibouti. On February 5, 2013, CMPort’s wholly-owned subsidiary, China Merchants Holdings (Djibouti) FZE, acquired 23.5% equity stake in Port De Djibouti S.A. (PDSA) for $185 million to participate in the restructuring of the Port de Djibouti. However, DCT’s consent was never sought at any point in time prior to, or during, the construction and development phase of the Doraleh Multipurpose Port (DMP). Mr. Aboubaker Omar Hadi, Chairman, Djibouti Ports and Free Zones Authority (DPFZA), took the position that the Republic of Djibouti did not need to take DCT’s consent as the DMP was not an “additional” container handling facility, but a “replacement” for the Old Port.  DP World commenced arbitration proceedings against the Republic of Djibouti in the London Court of International Arbitration on July 8, 2014. The London Court of International Arbitration eventually found the Republic of Djibouti to be in breach of its agreement with DP World and issued a ruling on March 19, 2019 ordering it to pay $385.7 million (plus interest) as compensation to DP World.There are some indications that the China Eximbank preferential buyer's credit for Phase 1 of Doraleh Multipurpose Port and the Damerjog Livestock Export Terminal Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender.  According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the stock of the Government of Djibouti's external arrears -- including arrears to China, Belgium, Spain, Iran, Italy, Saudi Arabia, and UAE -- stood at $107 million in March 2020. Then, in May 2020, a Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) by the World Bank and the IMF concluded that Djibouti was at a high risk of debt distress. Then, on November 29, 2022, the South China Morning Post reported that the Government of Djibouti had suspended debt service payment to China Eximbank. Djibouti’s Ministry of Economy, Finance, and Industry responded to the South China Morning Post report by releasing a public statement on December 7, 2022. The statement by the Ministry of Economy, Finance, and Industry noted that the Government of Djibouti had honored 85% of its loan repayment obligations in 2022. It also acknowledged that, as part of the Debt Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI), China Eximbank agreed to suspend principal and interest payments due in 2020 and 2021 under multiple loan agreements, and that the Government of Djibouti’s debt service obligations tripled with the expiration of DSSI. Then, in 2023, Djibouti’s Ministry of Economy, Finance, and Industry published a report, which identified the Government of Djibouti’s total arrears to China as being equivalent to DJF 24,104,000,000 ($135,285,797) as of December 31, 2022.",Completion,Mixed,Loan (excluding debt rescheduling),Yes,OOF-like,Export-Import Bank of China (China Eximbank),Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC),Government of Djibouti,China Civil Engineering Construction Corporation (CCECC)|China State Construction Engineering Corporation (CSCEC)|Port De Djibouti S.A.,,406755069.8,11.5969097,43.0691988,https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/480879281,precise

(75% equity stake) that is itself jointly owned by China Harbour Engineering Company Ltd (52.50% equity stake) and Tolaram (22.5% equity stake), Lagos State Government (20% equity stake), and the Nigerian Ports Authority (5% equity stake) — signed a concession agreement for the Lekki Deep Water Port Project. LPLEL was awarded a 45-year concession on a Build, Own, Operate and Transfer (BOOT) basis. It is responsible, under the terms of the concession agreement to develop, finance, build, operate and, at the end of the concession term, transferring the Lekki Deep Water Port (located in the Lagos Free Trade Zone) to NPA. LPLEL will earn revenues through operations of the port. Upon completion, Lekki Port is expected to have a total of 3 container berths, 1 dry bulk berth and 3 liquid berths. The port is projected to have the capacity to handle about 5.5 million containers and estimated to generate 200,000 direct and indirect jobs in the economy. It is also expected to generate over $361 billion over the 45-year concession period with the Government of Nigeria earning about $200 billion. CMA Terminals Nigeria, a subsidiary of French shipping company CMA CGM, which it jointly owns with China Harbour Engineering Company (CHEC), will operate the port once it opens in 2022, following the signing of a sub-concession agreement on September 30, 2019.  On October 23, 2019, China Development Bank (CDB) and LPLEL signed a long-term, $629 million commercial loan agreement for Phase 1 of the Lekki Deep Water Port Project. The borrowing terms of the loan are unknown. However, it is known that the borrower purchased a credit insurance policy from Sinosure. The proceeds of the loan (captured via Project ID#85628) were to be used by the borrower to partially finance a $679 million commercial (EPC) contract with CHEC, which was signed on May 11, 2012. On the same day, CDB and Lekki Free Trade Zone Enterprise Limited signed a Sponsor Support Agreement, Completion Guarantee Agreement and the Tripartite Keep well Agreement as well as seven security documents. The total cost of Phase 1 is $1.043 billion. CHEC made a $221,047,248 direct equity investment in Phase 1 of the project on March 30, 2020 (captured via Project ID#87054).  The first, $60 million CDB loan tranche was disbursed on April 29, 2021 after Lekki Free Trade Zone Enterprise Limited had satisfied all the conditions precedent for the release of the funds. Additional debt financing was reportedly provided by Agence Francaise de Developpement (AFD), European Investment Bank, FMO, IFC, African Finance Corporation, DEG, Rand Merchant Bank, Standard Chartered, and Stanbic Bank. CHEC is the EPC contractor responsible for implementation. A formal groundbreaking ceremony took place on March 29, 2018. Phase 1 construction activities commenced on June 15, 2020. Then, in October 2020, construction of a 680 meter long quay wall commenced, with the driving of the first sets of piles underway. Speaking at the flag-off ceremony at the project site, the Chief Executive Officer of Lekki Port, Mr. Ruogang Du, said that the commencement of piling of the quay wall, which is a major phase of the construction, symbolized a significant step towards the timely delivery of the project. In late November 2020, Mr. Rotimi Amaechi, Nigeria’s Minister of Transportation directed Dr. Magdalene Ajani, the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry, and the legal department to document an agreement with the Lekki Port LFTZ Enterprise Ltd., to ensure that the port becomes operational in 2022. The Minister of Transportation gave this directive while inspecting the project.  In late March 2021, it was announced that the project had achieved a 48% completion rate and would begin commercial operations during the first quarter of 2023. In early May 2021, Lekki Port LFTZ Enterprise Limited announced that construction of the Lekki Deep Seaport had reached a nearly 50% completion rate. At that time, the 1,909 meter long core of the main breakwater was completed, and work on the quay wall and landside infrastructure has reached advanced stages. This milestone of the completion of the core of the main breakwater was achieved on April 29, 2021. The Managing Director, Lekki Port LFTZ Enterprise Limited, Mr. Du Ruogang, affirmed that construction would be completed as scheduled (with a planned completion date of September 2022) and a targeted commercial operations date in Q4 2022. He also affirmed that the container terminal operator – Lekki Freeport Terminal, a subsidiary of CMA/CGM — was ready to commence operations (under a bespoke sub-concession arrangement) once construction was complete. In early August 2021, it was announced that the Lekki Deep Sea Port Project was moving forward according to schedule with 58.15% of the construction works having been completed. Phase 1 was ultimately completed when a project handover certificate was issued on October 24, 2022. Upon completion, it was originally expected that Phase 1 would increase the port’s handling capacity by 1.2 million twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs).

55,Lomé Container Terminal,Togo,Africa,2011,64343,Yes,No,China (People's Republic of),0,0,China Development Bank provides a $46.64 million USD loan for the Lomé Container Terminal Project,"In December 2011, Togo’s Ministry of Transport and Ministry of Economy and Finance awarded a project company and special purpose vehicle called Lomé Container Terminal S.A. (LCT) a 35-year concession agreement (franchise agreement) — with an optional 10-year extension — to develop, construct and operate a greenfield transshipment container terminal within the Port of Lomé (see pg.5 of 'CAO ASSESSMENT REPORT...').LCT was established in December 2008 and it is indirectly wholly owned by Thesar Maritime Limited (TML), which is a joint venture between Global Terminal Limited (GTL) and Oasis King International Limited (OKI). GTL is wholly owned by Terminal Investment Limited (TIL), while OKI is 70% indirectly owned by China Merchants Holding International (CMHI) and 30% owned by the China Africa Development Fund (CADF), a wholly owned company of China Development Bank (CDB). TIL is a subsidiary of the Italian-Swiss shipowner Mediterranean Shipping Company (MSC) (see 'The China Merchants in Djibouti...').[Note: In August 2012, CMHI through its wholly-owned subsidiary OKL acquired a 50% stake in Thesar Maritime Limited (see '招商局国际收购西非多哥集装箱码头50%股份'). TIL merged with GTL in a reorganization in December 2012; the shareholders of TML (and LCT, by extension) at that time were CMHI and TIL on an equal (50/50) basis (see '多哥 洛美集装箱码头'). CMHI later transferred 30% stake of OKI to the CADF; as a result, CMHI’s effective interest in TML was 35% as of December 31, 2017 (see pg.5 of 'CAO ASSESSMENT REPORT...).] According to the World Bank in 2011, the Lomé Container Terminal Project cost $442 million USD and was financed according to 75:25 debt-to-equity ratio. In 2011, LCT signed a $331.5 million USD lending agreement with a group of banks for the project — including the International Finance Corporation (IFC), the African Development Bank (AfDB), the Netherlands Development Finance Company (FMO), German Investment and Development Corporation (DEG), and China Development Bank (CDB) — for the Lomé Container Terminal Project. The International Finance Corporation (IFC) was the sole lead arranger of the debt package (see 'Lome Container Terminal, Togo'). CDB provided a $46.64 million USD loan for the project; however, the borrowing terms of its loan are unknown (see 'World Bank Infrastructure Finance Report: Lome Container Terminal'). The breakdown of the debt package for the rest of Lomé Container Terminal Project was as follows: the IFC provided a loan of $116 million USD; the African Development Bank (AfDB) provided a loan of $75.56 million USD; Germany's KfW provided a loan of $46.64 million USD (see 'World Bank Infrastructure Finance Report: Lome Container Terminal'). The remaining $110.5 million was provided via equity contributions from the Mediterranean Shipping Company (MSC) (see 'World Bank Infrastructure Finance Report: Lome Container Terminal').However, there were several other financiers for the project unreported by the World Bank. The OPEC Fund for International Development (OFID) provided €30 million EUR (€20 million in 2012, €10 million in 2015) for the project (see 'OFID signs new financing agreement for Togo’s Lomé Container Terminal'). The Netherlands Development Finance Company (FMO) provided €35 million EUR (€25 million in 2011, €10 million in 2015) for the project (see 'LOME CONTAINER TERMINAL SA'). Proparco provided a €30 million EUR loan for the project in 2011 (see 'LOAN TO LCT TO BUILD A CONTAINER TERMINAL...').The purpose of this project was to construct three berths — that have a total coastline of 1,050 meters, a water depth of 16.6 meters, and an area of 53 hectares — at the Port of Lomé. Upon completion, the container terminal was expected to have an annual handling capacity of 2.2 million 20-feet container units (TEU) (see '招商局港口多哥洛美港项目推介'). The terminal was designed to accommodate container cargo ships 16.6 m over Panamax size (see pg.4-5 of 'The Project for The Study on Togo Logistics Corridor Development'). The planned maximum vessel size that the port could accommodate was 14,000 TEU (see 'Port of Lomé Togo').The Port of Lomé was one of the few deep-water ports in Western and Central Africa; it served as a shipment hub towards land-locked Mali, Niger, and Burkina Faso, as well as northern Nigeria. The port had an existing capacity of 221,000 TEU on the West African coast because of its ideal location. It also served as a gateway to landlocked Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso, as well as the northern parts of Nigeria. The port’s existing capacity was 221,000 container units; the project, by seeking to expand it, was addressing growing Togolese needs and regional demand for more trade (see 'Boosting Regional Integration and Trade in West Africa...').The Khouri Group Ltd. received a $250 million USD contract to construct a 300 meter sand barrier, clear the existing landscape, and bank the area with sand with a thickness of about 2,00 meters, compact the terminal surface, build dock walls and foundations for gantries and cranes, open the main jetty at depth and dredge the harbor basin, create a storage area for hazardous material, and construct buildings, fences, electric lines, and a road, rail, and waterways network (see 'New Construction: State of the art Harbor; Lomé, TOGO'). Finnish company Konecranes Oyj provided a 22 16-wheel electric rubber tyred gantry (RTG) cranes, with a lifting capacity of 40 tons, for the container terminal (see 'More Konecranes RTGs to Port of Lomé, Togo'). Spanish company Humiclima S.A. was responsible for the installation of the ventilation, air conditioning, plumbing, sewage, and fire systems in the terminal's administrative, customs, and goods receipt offices (see 'LOME CONTAINER TERMINAL'). German company RMT Industrie- und Elektrotechnik GmbH was responsible for the installation of the design, provision, and installation of the electrical equipment - emergency generators, MV and LV electricity supply, and lighting and communications equipment - for the terminal (see 'OUR PROJECTS').Project Management International (PMI Ltd.) was contracted by LCT to conduct marine, offshore geotechnical, onshore geotechnical, and marine condition surveys for the project (see 'Lomé Container Terminal GSI'). Staff of Spanish company Ingeomar S.L.P. acted as technical advisors during construction {{see Source ID#123510}}. RBS EMEA UG was contracted to provide its terminal operating system (TOPS) suite, a web frontend, and a KPI tool for the management of the container terminal (see 'Selected Success Stories'). Togo's Ministry of Public Works and Transport (now the Ministry of Infrastructure and Transport) supervised the project, while the Autonomous Port of Lomé was responsible for the implementation of construction projects and operation of port infrastructures at the port (see pg.6 of 'Executive Summary of the Environmental and Social Impact Assessment...').MSC, which has a 12% share of the international container shipping market, was expected to serve as LCT’s “anchor customer.' (see 'Boosting Regional Integration and Trade in West Africa...').  LCT was the contractor responsible for implementation. Construction was underway some time before January 23, 2014 (see '胡平参赞走访洛美集装箱码头项目'). LCT put the port into trial operation on October 23, 2014, although some construction continued beyond this point (see '多哥 洛美集装箱码头'). Most construction had been completed by December 2015 (see '招商局港口多哥洛美港项目推介'). All construction was eventually completed (see pg.5 of 'Assessing the Risks of Chinese Investments in Sub-Saharan African Ports'). The port was jointly operated by TIL and CMHI (see pg.5 of 'CAO ASSESSMENT REPORT...'). The container terminal was a boon to the Port of Lomé, which saw an increase the number of containers transiting the port, as of December 31, 2017, container throughput handled by LCT was 0.89 million TEUs compared to 0.53 million TEUs in 31 December 2016, a year-on-year increase of 67.5%. As a result, the Port of Lomé over took the Port of Lagos as the leading port in West Africa (see 'Lomé’s port becomes West Africa’s leading container port, overtaking Lagos’').

According to Moguldom Nation, the loan wielded a 25-year maturity and 5-year grace period. It is unclear whether the two sides ever signed a final financing agreement for this project. As of February 2018, the Government of Zanzibar was still negotiating with China Eximbank for this loan facility. In June 2019, the Daily News reported that Zanzibar's Minister of Infrastructure, Communication, and Transport said negotiations with China Exim Bank had stalled and therefore the Government of Tanzania would use its own funds to support this project. On the other hand, according to a 2019 report from the World Bank, construction was ongoing with financing from China Exim Bank. A November 2020 article from The Citizen suggests that Zanzibar was completely starting over on this project and a January 2021 article from the same source describes a similar multipurpose port project now being implementing with Oman. Therefore it is unclear whether a final financing agreement with China Eximbank was ever signed. In addition to $200 million of debt financing from China Eximbank, China Harbor Engineering Company (CHEC) signed an agreement pledging to provide another $30 million USD of equity financing on the condition that 13% of port shares will be lent back to CHEC after the completion of the project. CHEC signed the 36-month EPC contract on 21 February 2014. However, the project encountered various delays that had delayed implementation. The purpose of this project aims to boost trade by constructing a new harbor in the Maruhubi area of Zanzibar. The port of Zanzibar is managed, operated and developed by the Zanzibar Ports Corporation (ZPC), a parastatal organization regulated by the Zanzibar Maritime Authority (ZMA). With approximately 1.5 million passengers per year, Malindi has one of the busiest passenger terminals in the East African region. However, the port was severely congested and dated so the 2007 Zanzibar Transport Master Plan created the Zanzibar New Port Project to solve those issues. The completed port is to include 300 meters of docking space, 65 meters for land craft, modern handling equipment for up to 200,000 containers and 250,000 tons of loose cargo.",Pipeline: Pledge,Development,Loan (excluding debt rescheduling),Yes,ODA-like,Export-Import Bank of China,"China Harbour Engineering Co., Ltd.",Government of Tanzania,"China Harbour Engineering Co., Ltd.|Zanzibar Ports Corporation (ZPC)",,225607310.4,-6.1674617,39.2485549,,approximate location

Then, on August 1, 2017, the Chinese Government officially inaugurated the PLA Military Support Base in Djibouti. It is is 0.5 square kilometers (0.2 sq mi) in size and staffed by approximately 1,000-2,000 personnel, and has an underground space of 23,000 square meters. The base has a 400 meter runway with an air traffic control tower, as well as a large helicopter apron. The base also houses the PLA Support Base Hospital in Djibouti. The first live fire exercises were conducted on September 22, 2017. Then, around May 2018, the Chinese Government began constructing a large-scale pier (over 330 meters in length or 1,120 feet) at the base, and it appeared to be fully completed after 18 months from a satellite photo taken in December 2019. Satellite analysis also suggests that the Chinese Government may be building a second pier or quay as to increase the naval capacity of the base.The Chinese Government funded the construction of the facility; however, neither the monetary value nor the financial modality used to support this project are known. According to IMF, the agreement signed in June 2015 between the Government of Djibouti and the Chinese Government on the establishment of military base was expected to generate $20 million a year of revenue for the Government of Djibouti (via rental payments).The base is physically co-located with the Port of Doraleh (which was constructed with a $344 million China Eximbank loan, as captured via Project ID#59375) to the west of Djibouti City.

Its construction content mainly includes 1 300,000 dwt iron ore export pier (2 berths), 1 breakwater in the southern side of the port, 150,000 dwt fertilizer berth, 2 50,000 dwt multi-purpose berths, 4km-long 200,000 dwt channel, 4.2km-long 50,000 dwt channel, port area dump site with the total land area of about 1,175,000 square meters, marine reclamation land with an area of about 1,396,000 square meters and phase-I project with a total through capacity of 41.95 million ton per year. Besides, this project also covers the construction of the 19km-long highway to port and 29.6km-long railway to port (see: 'CRBC Signs the Business Contract for Pointe Noire New Port Project in Congo-Brazzaville').The project is linked to #30501, Eximbank's portion of the funding for the port.",Pipeline: Pledge,Development,Vague TBD,Vague,Vague (Official Finance),China Road & Bridge Corporation (CRBC),,Government of Republic of Congo,China Road & Bridge Corporation (CRBC),,407377555.4,-4.7975373,11.8503297,,approximate location
74,Port of Banjul,Gambia,Africa,2017,56668,No,No,China (People's Republic of),0,0,China Eximbank pledges $177 million government concessional loan for Banjul Port Extension Project,"In its 2015 Financial Statement and Annual Report, the Gambia Ports Authority (GPA) disclosed that it had signed an MOU with China Harbour and Engineering Corporation (CHEC) regarding the Banjul Port Extension Project and it intended to apply for a China Eximbank loan to finance this project. Then, on October 2, 2017, the Government of the Gambia’s Finance and Economic Affairs Minister Amadou Sanneh submitted an application to China Eximbank for a $177,077,885 government concessional loan (GCL) to support Banjul Port Extension Project. The proposed borrowing terms of the loan were as follows: a 2% interest rate, a 20 year maturity, and a 7 year grace period. The proceeds of the loan would be used to finance 100% of the cost of a commercial (EPC) contract with China Road and Bridge Corporation (CRBC). The Banjul Port Extension Project, if implemented, would install a new jetty, an approach bridge, channel dredging, maintenance of the dredging rehabilitation container terminal, a head office for use of the port authority, and repairs to the Banjul wharf. However, this project has been plagued by domestic controversy and it does not appear that a loan agreement with China Eximbank has been finalized. The Gambian Ministry of Justice questioned the legality of the Government of the Gambia’s contract with CRBC because it was issued without following standard competitive bidding procedures. Another concern that arose was the fact that a feasibility study for the project that was carried out by CRBC and it put the cost of the project at $123,697,885.77, yet the cost of the CRBC contract identified in the government’s loan application to China Eximbank was $177,077,885. This discrepancy of $53,380,000 prompted allegations that the contract price was artificially inflated. Then, on June 4, 2018, the Gambian Works Minister, Bai Lamin Jobe, convened a meeting with Secretary General, Habib Drammeh, GPA Board Chairman, Alpha Barry, MD, GPA, Abdoulie Tambadou and Permanent Secretary of Works, Mariama Ndure-Njie to discuss how the EPC contract with CRBC. At this meeting, the Gambian Works Minister reportedly decided not address four issues related to the EPC contract that were by flagged by external consultants (GAMWORKS and NIRAS Consulting Engineers of Denmark) but rejected by CBRC: concerns about the $177 million face value of the China Eximbank loan, the establishment of unit prices/rates after the completion of detailed project design work, the absence of a value-for-money analysis, and GPA requirements. The Gambia’s Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Finance, Lamin Camara, also raised concerns with the Works Minister, Secretary General and the GPA Board Chairman, noting in email correspondence that ‘I MUST say once again that the country is not in position to absorb such a loan facility as it will eventually take us to a very serious level of debt unsustainability and would eventually make us miss our programs with the [IMF] and the [World Bank] and that may ultimately affect the gains we achieved in the Barrow government.’ He also warned that the ‘[China Eximbank] loan facility comprises of one fifth of the whole public debt of the country so there is no way it can be financed given the current situation’.",Pipeline: Pledge,Commercial,Loan (excluding debt rescheduling),Yes,OOF-like,Export-Import Bank of China (China Eximbank),,Government of Gambia,"China Communications Construction Co., Ltd.

The financing package consisted of a 13-year A loan from the World Bank's International Finance Corporation ( IFC), a 13-year B loan from Costa Rica's regional infrastructure financing corporation CIFI, and two 10-year loans from banks Banco Espirito Santo and WestLB. IFC and the Central American Mezzanine Infrastructure Fund (CAMIF) also provided a joint 10.5-year C loan.The first phase of the $224 million project involved the construction of a new international container terminal — including a 440 meter berth, two ship-to-shore gantry cranes, seven rubber-tired gantry cranes (RTGs) and ancillary facilities — in the Port City of Buenaventura at the Aguacate Marsh before the Cascajal Island. The container terminal is located in Buenaventura’s urban area, 2.4 kilometers away from the existing terminal of Sociedad Portuaria Regional de Buenaventura. Upon completion, the terminal was expected to provide approximately 268,000 twenty foot equivalent units (“TEUs”) in operational capacity and only handle containers.Then, in 2014, TCBuen secured a second financing package for the second phase of the project. The total cost of Phase 2 was $157.9 million and it was financed in part with a $25 million A loan from the IFC and a $65 million B loan from a syndicate of banks. The purpose of Phase 2 was to expand and modernize the Port of Buenaventura and increase its capacity to 610,000 TEUs. Then, in 2018, TCBuen signed a $140 million syndicated secured term loan facility agreement with four banks — Banco Santander, SA; Bank of China (Luxembourg) SA Stockholm Branch; Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Limited Seoul Branch; and Banco Sabadell SA, Miami Branch — to refinance its existing debts from the project’s construction phase (Phase 1).Construction of the container terminal began in August 2008. Maritime operations began on January 27, 2011. The expansion of the terminal began in 2014. This project has been a subject of local controversy. On December 10, 2009, a local coalition of community councils – Proceso de Comunidades Negras - Regional Palenque El Congal1 (“PCN”) – requested the assistance of the Office of the Compliance Advisor/Ombudsman (CAO) on behalf of community members in Buenaventura to address alleged impacts on vulnerable afro-Colombian communities of the Malecón Project. When the CAO pointed out that the Malecón Project was a Governmental Initiative not funded by IFC and had no apparent link with the IFC-funded private sector TCBuen Project in a different area of Buenaventura, the PCN, together with Fundación Huellas y Rostros del Sentir Humano “Garífuna”, submitted a second version of the complaint describing impacts of TCBuen on its neighboring communities.

The facility has a maturity of 15 years, and the Government of Angola is not required to make any repayments under the facility until the end of the disbursement period, which ends sixty months after the effective date of the facility (meaning the grace period is 5 years). The Government of Angola did not issue a sovereign guarantee for the loan, but China Export & Credit Insurance Corporation (Sinosure) provided an export credit insurance policy for the facility and Eximbank provided 85% of the premium. The proceeds of the loan were used to finance up to 85% of the price of a commercial contract between Caioporto, S.A. and China Road and Bridge Corporation (CRBC).Caioporto, S.A. is a special purpose vehicle (SPV) established and owned by the Government of Angola’s Sovereign Wealth Fund (Fundo Soberano de Angola) for the financing, construction and management of a deep-water commercial port in the village of Caio within Cabinda Province.  The only equity in this project was provided by a $180 million investment from Angola's Fundo Soberano de Angola (FSDEA) and an unknown investment amount by Quantum Global Group, an investment group founded by Swiss-Angolan Jean-Claude Bastos de Morais.The Port of Caio Construction Project is being implemented in multiple phases.  The first phase involves the construction a 630 meter seaport wall, a 2 km bridge and access pier to the seaport terminal with 2km length, a 180 meter access channel, and a 200 meter-wide, 14 meter-deep docking basin.  The second phase involves the construction of a 200 meter-wide, 18 meter-deep access channel and a docking pier that is 1,130 meters long and 16 meters deep with the capacity to dock 4 large ships simultaneously and welcome some of the world’s largest ships.  Upon completion, the port will have the capacity to move about 60 containers per hour.  The project will cover an area of over 2,500 hectares, where customs facilities, workshops with port support and ship repair services, warehouses and commercial establishments will be built.Phase 1 construction began in June 2017; however, as of March 2022, no funds had been disbursed through the China Eximbank facility agreement.Then, on May 30, 2018, the contract for the project was halted by Presidential Order No. 66/18, effectively terminating the execution of the port project between Caioporto, S.A. and Angola’s Ministry of Transport. A year later, Presidential Order No. 166/19 halted the commission for the termination of the port project (in effect, undoing Presidential Order No. 66/18 and reactivating the project) and authorized the Angolan Minister of Transport to grant one of the port terminals of Porto do Caio to Caioporto, S.A. to guarantee the implementation of the project. Presidential Order No. 166/19 also made Caioporto, S.A. entirely owned by the Government of Angola’s Sovereign Wealth Fund (Fundo Soberano de Angola) after Jean-Claude Bastos de Morais (who was removed from his position at Fundo Soberano de Angola on suspicions of financial mismanagement) returned his assets to the Angolan Government.Construction was halted again in early 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic but it resumed in August 2020.

It found that the port needed two more berths to handle container traffic. Then, on April 15, 2010, the Tanzania Port Authority and CCCC signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) for a feasibility study. It was carried out in May 2010 and established a scope of work for the Dar es Salaam Container Terminal Expansion Project (or Dar es Salaam Harbor Upgrade Project). This project would involve the construction of two more berths (13 and 14), the dredging of an entrance channel, and the creation of a container stacking yard to better handle container traffic. The Government of Tanzania subsequently submitted a loan application to China Eximbank.Circa 2012, the Export-Import Bank of China agreed — at least in principle — to issue a $587.35 million concessional loan to the Government of Tanzania for the Dar es Salaam Container Terminal Expansion Project. The borrowing terms of the loan included a 2% interest rate and a 20 year maturity. The proceeds of the loan were to be used to finance approximately 85% of the total cost of a $691 million commercial contract. The Government of Tanzania would be responsible for finance the remaining 15%.However, in 2013, the CCCC contract was cancelled on overpricing grounds and a Congolese company known as Impala Africa was selected as the new contractor responsible for project implementation. Ephraim Mgawe, Director General of the TPA, was later sentenced to five years imprisonment in January 2017 for the fraudulent awarding of the Dar es Salaam Harbor Upgrade Project to the China Communications Construction Company, Ltd, in order to secure a China Eximbank loan. CCCC later brought litigation against the Tanzania Port Authority over the contract. It took the position that the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Transport decided to call for new tenders before termination of the contract and awarded the tender to contractors other than the CCCC on grounds that the Ministry of Transport had been directed by the Public Procurement Regulatory Authority not to deal with the company as it was among those banned by the World Bank.The World Bank, DFID, and TPA eventually stepped in to finance this project. In June 2017, CHEC signed a $154 million commercial contract to implement the World Bank-financed project. Project implementation commenced in July 2017.

Then, on November 19, 2012, China Eximbank and Djibouti’s Ministry of Finance signed an RMB 426,000,000 (FDJ 11,400,000,000/$63,998,908) government concessional loan (GCL) agreement for the Djibouti Assal Lake Salt Export Terminal Project at the Port of Goubet. The borrowing terms of the GCL were as follows: a 7.5-year maturity, a 5-year grace period, a 2.5% interest rate, a 0.5% management fee, and a 0.5% commitment fee. According to Djibouti’s Ministry of Economy, Finance, and Industry, the GCL (loan) had achieved a 20.8% disbursement rate as of 2014 ($13,354,884 out of $63,998,908) and it ultimately achieved a 82.4% disbursement rate (FDJ 9,388,000,000 out of FDJ 11,400,000,000).The cargo facility at the Port of Goubet was designed to facilitate the export of salt and gypsum deposits from Lake Assal, the world’s largest undeveloped salt reserve and the second most saline body of water on Earth after Don Juan Pond in Antarctica. This project sought to create a port with a depth of 14 meters, and a terminal bulk carrier located 17 meters from the extraction zone. The project also involved the rehabilitation of a 8.4 km road connecting the terminal to the extraction zone. The Port of Goubet is located 40 km south of the Gulf of Goubet, and its construction was designed to help Djibouti export 5 million tons of salt annually to Southeast Asian countries. China Harbor Engineering Company Ltd., a subsidiary of China Communications Construction Company Ltd., was the contractor responsible for project implementation. Construction began on November 7, 2013, and the President of Djibouti inaugurated the mineral port on June 22, 2017.  The completion of this project paved the way for a longer-term commercial investment by China Harbor Engineering Company Ltd. and China Communications Construction Company Ltd.. In 2015, CCCC Resource — a joint venture of Overseas Business Department of China Communications Construction Company Ltd. and China Harbor Engineering Company Ltd. — purchased a 65% equity stake in Djibouti Salt Investment Company (吉布提鹽業投資公司 or SIS). Then, on August 22, 2017, the Government of Djibouti and Djibouti Salt Investment Company signed a concession agreement, which granted Djibouti Salt Investment Company the exclusive rights to develop and extract salt and bromine resources from Lake (Lac) Assal and develop a salt chemical (sodium bromide) industrial park for 50 years. Lake Assal reportedly contains around 2 billion tons of salt minerals that had previously been harvested only in small quantities through traditional methods.There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan for the Djibouti Assal Lake Salt Export Terminal Project at the Port of Goubet may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the stock of the Government of Djibouti's external arrears -- including arrears to China, Belgium, Spain, Iran, Italy, Saudi Arabia, and UAE -- stood at $107 million in March 2020. Then, in May 2020, a Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) by the World Bank and the IMF concluded that Djibouti was at a high risk of debt distress. Then, on November 29, 2022, the South China Morning Post reported that the Government of Djibouti had suspended debt service payment to China Eximbank. Djibouti’s Ministry of Economy, Finance, and Industry responded to the South China Morning Post report by releasing a public statement on December 7, 2022. The statement by the Ministry of Economy, Finance, and Industry noted that the Government of Djibouti had honored 85% of its loan repayment obligations in 2022. It also acknowledged that, as part of the Debt Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI), China Eximbank agreed to suspend principal and interest payments due in 2020 and 2021 under multiple loan agreements, and that the Government of Djibouti’s debt service obligations tripled with the expiration of DSSI. Then, in 2023, Djibouti’s Ministry of Economy, Finance, and Industry published a report, which identified the Government of Djibouti’s total arrears to China as being equivalent to DJF 24,104,000,000 ($135,285,797) as of December 31, 2022.",Completion,Development,Loan (excluding debt rescheduling),Yes,ODA-like,Export-Import Bank of China (China Eximbank),,Djiboutian Ministry of Economy and Finance,"China Harbour Engineering Co., Ltd.

The railway has three sections: (1) the Nacala-to-Velha section that connects the village of Andre Mossuril to the town of Nacala-a-Velha; (2) the Lumbo section that connects the city of Monapo to the port village of Lumbo; and (3) the Cuamba-Lichinga section that connects the town of Cuamba to the city of Lichinga. The project also involves the construction of an export terminal and a coal storage yard at the port of Nacala-a-Velha. Upon completion, the project will facilitate rail and ship transport of produced coal up to a volume of 18 million tons per annum. China Communications Construction Group Ltd. was one of the contractors involved in that implementation of this project. A groundbreaking ceremony for this project took place on May 12, 2017.

The project is being implemented in two phases. Phase 1 involves the dredging of the access channel, the extension of the breakwater northward by 1.75 kilometers (to reduce the intensity of wave action inshore), the construction of bulk oil service terminal, the construction of quay walls, the reclamation of a land area of 53,000 hectares, the installation of new security and fire service posts, the installation of new entry and exit gates, and the construction of an access road to the port and a new bridge over the existing railway line and reclamation works. Phase 2 involves involves the development of physical infrastructure within the port, including the construction of good road network in and out of the port and the construction of a container terminal in Sekondi. Upon completion, it is expected that the TPEP will position Takoradi Port as a petroleum hub providing services for offshore operations in Ghana and the West African sub-region. On August 31, 2012, China Harbour Engineering Company (CHEC) signed a $150 million commercial (EPC) contract with Ghana Ports and Harbours Authority (GPHA) for the implementation of the first phase of the project.

In July 2017, CCCC signed an investment agreement with WPR Participações (a Brazilian firm and subsidiary of WTorre Group) for building the terminal. Then, on March 16, 2018, ICBC, represented by ICBC Brazil, signed a financing mandate letter committing to provide a loan for this project. The loan's face value and borrowing terms are unknown. However, it is known that the purpose of this loan was to cover the 70% of the over $700 million total project cost. The remaining 30% was expected to come in the form of an equity investment from CCCC (captured via Project ID #62080).The Private Use Terminal Construction Project at Porto São Luís is intended to improve supply chain operations in the agricultural industries from mid-West Brazil (States of Mato Grosso, Goiás, Tocantins, Pará, Maranhão, and Piauí). Works involve construction of a water port with four berths and supporting storage facilities. This is a greenfield private port terminal located in the Organized Port Complex of Itaqui, in the municipality of São Luís, State of Maranhão. The port would be strategically located to facilitate the export of grains coming from the mid-West and the imports of fertilizers, grain, oil, pulp, and other liquid bulks to the North region.Port San Luis was supposed to be jointly constructed by CCCC South America Regional Company, Concremat (subsidiary of CCCC), Second Harbor Engineering (SHEC, also a subsidiary of CCCC), Thorell, Lyon Capital, and WPR Participações. According to the Executive President of Concremat, 'most of the supply chain will be Brazilian, with specific equipment coming from China.' On March 16, 2018, CCCC signed the EPC agreement and the groundbreaking ceremony took place. Construction was scheduled to last three years. According to an August 2018 article from Concremat (a subsidiary of CCCC), workers had began earthworks and drilling onshore and offshore. The peak of work was expected to occur between June 2019 and April 2021. As of November 2021, Porto São Luís is scheduled to start operations in 2025.This project was constructed on a BOO+EPC basis meaning CCCC would build, own, and operate the port. In December 2017, CCCC officially completed the investment transaction and officially took a 51% controlling stake in the project. Lyon Capital owns 20% of stakes, WPR owns 24%, and the rest is held by unspecified shareholders.According to a document from April 2020, this project was stalled due to environmental issues and public backlash. The Port of San Luis is located in a vast mangrove area where local and migratory birds and various marine species breed. CCCC did not fulfill official requests to establish a conservation unit in the project area. There are also archaeological and a sacred historical sites that the CCCC has also failed to protect. The environmental licenses for this project have been obtained without consultation with affected human communities, especially the Cajueiro people. There have been reports that project developers have threatened local leaders, pressured communities to sell their land, unlawfully demolished houses, and destroyed forests. Brazilians are calling for the project to be canceled due to its negative environmental and social impacts. In 2019, local military forces have clashed with protestors attempting to protect their homes from demolition (see also 'Besieged by progress' and 'Public Letter' and 'São Luis megaport conflict intensifies').In November 2021, Cosan Group (a Brazilian company controlled by Atlântico Participações) signed an agreement with CCCC to acquire 100% of shares for the Private Use Terminal Construction Project at Porto São Luís. They immediately acquired the minority stake equal to 49% and will proceed with negotiations with CCCC for their 51% stake. A Cosan representative said that a “memorandum of understanding for the construction of the Port, aimed at the outflow of ore, was signed with Concremat and companies of the CCCC group. The definitive contracts for the construction of the port are conditioned to the closing of the acquisition of 100% of the shares of the port project.” The Government of Maranhao was involved in coordinating this change in ownership.

107,Queen Elizabeth II Quay,Sierra Leone,Africa,2017,62224,Yes,No,China (People's Republic of),2017,0,"China Eximbank contributes $130 million to $659 million syndicated loan for Port Elizabeth II Upgrading and Expansion Project (Linked to to Project ID#62222, #62223)","On March 25, 2015, the Government of the Republic of Sierra Leone signed a framework agreement with a consortium of Chinese companies — consisting of Tidfore Heavy Equipment Group Co., Ltd., China Integrity International Oceaneering, Co., Ltd., Tidfore (Tianjin) Oceaneering Equipment Co., Ltd., and Tianjin Jinhao International Trade Co., Ltd. — regarding the design and construction of the works necessary for the expansion and upgrading of Port Elizabeth II in Freetown Port (also known as ‘Queen Elizabeth II Port’). Then, on September 15, 2017, the Sierra Leone Ports Authority, the National Commission for Privatization of the Republic of Sierra Leone, the Government of the Republic of Sierra Leone, Sky Rock Management Limited, and National Port Development (SL) Ltd. signed a concession agreement in connection with the Upgrade and Expansion of the Queen Elizabeth II Port in Freetown. The agreement granted National Port Development (SL) Ltd. (塞拉利昂共和国国家港口发展有限公) — a project company and special purpose vehicle (SPV) — the right to expand, upgrade, and operate Queen Elizabeth II Port for 25 years.On November 29, 2017, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of (ICBC) and the Export-Import Bank of China signed a $659 million syndicated facility (loan) agreement with National Port Development (SL) Ltd. for the Port Elizabeth II Upgrading and Expansion Project. Of the total $659 million (captured via Umbrella Project ID#62222), China Eximbank contributed $130 million (captured via Project ID#62224) and ICBC contributed $529 million (captured via Project ID#62223). The syndicated loan carries the following borrowing terms: a 15-year maturity, a 4-year grace period, an interest rate of LIBOR plus 350 basis points, and a commitment fee of 0.5%. The loan is secured by (i.e. collateralized against) project revenues/port development levy fees deposited in a lender-controlled bank account, the proceeds from the borrower’s Sinosure credit insurance policy, Sky Rock Management Ltd.’s equity stake (shares) in the project company [National Port Development (SL) Ltd.], project machinery and equipment, and all movable assets (tangible or intangible) of the concessionaire in connection with the ‘New Port’ (as defined in the concession agreement and AidData’s ‘Staff Comments’). Sierra Leone’s Ministry of Finance and Economic Development issued a sovereign guarantee for the loan, and the borrower was required to use part of the loan proceeds to purchase a credit insurance policy from China Export & Credit Insurance Corporation (Sinosure), which insures 95% of the facility plus accrued interest against political and commercial risk.The proceeds of the loan were to be used by the borrower, National Port Development (SL) Ltd., to finance a $708,295,101 commercial contract that it signed with a consortium of Chinese companies -- consisting of Tidfore Heavy Equipment Group Co., Ltd. (泰富重装集), China Integrity International Oceaneering, Co., Ltd., Tidfore (Tianjin) Oceaneering Equipment Co., Ltd., and Tianjin Jinhao International Trade Co., Ltd.-- which was signed on March 8, 2017 and amended on November 29, 2017. In order to facilitate loan repayment, Tidfore will collect a ‘development levy fee,’ which will be charged over and above the usual port handling charges. This fee is expected to generate $950 million over a 16 year period. Sierra Leone’s Ministry of Finance and Economic Development has reportedly flagged that this fee could raise the cost using the port to such a high level that shippers will avoid using it, thereby leading to an overall loss of revenue and threatening the borrower’s ability to repay the loan (thus raising concerns about the Government of Sierra Leone’s contingent liability).The purpose of the Port Elizabeth II Upgrading Project is to renovate the facilities at Queen Elizabeth II Quay in Freetown, which is operated by Sierra Leone Ports Authority. It involves the design and construction of four new terminals and yards for the quay. A formal groundbreaking ceremony took place on November 29, 2017, and construction began in December 2017.This project has become a source of local controversy and scrutiny. In 2018, the implementation of the project was reportedly halted (at least temporarily) after reports emerged that the legal entity responsible for the project—National Port Development (SL) Ltd.—was owned by Israeli businessman who had generously contributed to the President of Sierra Leone’s reelection campaign during the previous year. The IMF also sounded the alarm after learning that Sierra Leone’s Ministry of Finance issued a sovereign guarantee in support of a syndicated loan, which placed an extraordinarily large contingent liability (worth 15% of the country’s GDP) on the government’s books.",Implementation,Mixed,Loan (excluding debt rescheduling),Yes,OOF-like,Export-Import Bank of China (China Eximbank),Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC),National Port Development Ltd.

This action came roughly four years before the Chinese Government and the Government of São Tomé and Príncipe resumed diplomatic relations (on December 26, 2017). Shortly after establishing a trade mission in São Tomé and Príncipe (on November 14, 2013), the Chinese Government expressed interest in funding the construction a deep-water seaport in São Tomé and Príncipe. The estimated cost of this project was $400 million. Its purpose was to facilitate the export of oil and sea-borne commerce. Then, in October 2015, the Government of São Tomé and Príncipe (STP) signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with China Harbor Engineering Company (CHEC) regarding the potential construction of the seaport as a Public-Private Partnership (PPP). The MOU specified that CHEC would first assess the feasibility of the project. Also, according to the MoU, CHEC reportedly pledged to invest at least $120 million. China Road and Bridge Corporation (CRBC), along with Macau Legend Development Ltd, also expressed interest in the deepwater seaport project. Then, in May 2017, the Chinese Government and the Government of São Tomé and Príncipe signed a bilateral cooperation agreement, in which the Chinese Government agreed to provide $146 million of funding for infrastructure projects between 2017 and 2022 to the Government of São Tomé and Príncipe (see Project ID#71266). One of the infrastructure projects identified in the bilateral cooperation agreement was the deepwater seaport project. However, in 2018, the Chinese Government began to raise concerns about the Government of São Tomé and Príncipe’s ability to take on substantially higher level public debt to facilitate the implementation of the project. In late November 2019, the STP’s Minister of Public Works, Infrastructure and Natural Resources, Osvaldo Abreu, announced the launch of the international tender for the construction of the deepwater port in the village of Fernão Dias within Lobata district. The project described in the international tender envisages a port with a depth of 16 meters and the construction of a multipurpose terminal with a capacity of up to 30,000 tons. The Government of the STP also invited construction companies to submit proposals to build the port according o a Design, Build, Finance and Operate (DBFO) model, which suggests that this project may ultimately be financed through a special purpose vehicle (SPV).",Pipeline: Pledge,Mixed,Vague TBD,No,OOF-like,Unspecified Chinese Government Institution,,Government of São Tomé & Príncipe,"China Harbour Engineering Co., Ltd.

113,Sierra Leone Fish Harbour,Sierra Leone,Africa,2019,62533,Yes,No,China (People's Republic of),0,0,Chinese Government provides RMB 450 million grant — via ECTA — for Fishery Harbor Project,"In August 2018, during an official visit to China, the Sierra Leonean President, Julius Maada Bio, signed an agreement with the Chinese Government regarding a feasibility study for a Fishery Harbor Project. Under the terms of the agreement, the Chinese Government agreed to dispatch a team of 9 experts to Sierra Leone to conduct a feasibility study for a project that would involve the construction of a fishing harbor (port) in the capital city of Freetown. Then, on February 1, 2019, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation of Sierra Leone and the Chinese Government signed an Economic and Technical Cooperation Agreement (经济技术合作协议 or ECTA), which officially committed RMB 200 million (approximately $29.8 million) of grant funding for the Fishery Harbor Project. However, in July 2021 Sierra Leone’s Parliament ratified an RMB 450 million grant agreement with the Chinese Government for the Fishery Harbor Project. The Chinese Government apparently increased the overall size of its grant commitment for the project by authorizing the use of RMB 250 million of additional grant funding for the Fishery Harbor Project that it had previously committed through an August 30, 2018 ECTA. The purpose of the project is to construct an industrial fishing harbor (port) — for tuna vessels and ‘other bigger fishing’ vessels exporting to international markets — at Black Johnson beach near a protected area called Western Area Peninsula national park. The project also involves a ‘waste-management component’ to ‘recycle marine and other wastes into useful products. Zhejiang Communications Investment Group Co., Ltd. is the contractor responsible for project implementation. Part of the land earmarked for the project is a lagoon in the dry season that opens up into a river during the rainy season. It acts as a fish breeding site, and its water flows into Whale Bay - renowned for whales, dolphins, turtles and many bird species – when it rains. Conservationists, human rights and animal welfare groups and local landowners, claim that the project would ‘destroy pristine rainforest, plunder fish stocks, pollute the marine environment and five individual ecosystems that are fish breeding grounds and support endangered bird and wildlife species.’ Two legal campaign groups, the Institute for Legal Research and Advocacy for Justice (ILRAJ) and Namati Sierra Leone, have written to the Government of Sierra Leone, under the 2013 Right to Access Information Act, demanding to see the environmental and social impact assessment studies for the project, and a government report showing that the beach was, as claimed, the most suitable place for construction ‘in terms of bathymetry, social safeguards (minimum resettlement costs) and environmental issues.’ They have also sought a copy of the grant agreement between the Chinese Government and the Government of Sierra Leone. Basita Michael, a lawyer for the ILRAJ, has said that ‘The press release was very vague. It left us wondering how did we arrive here and how come we are only hearing about this now. We have a right to know more.’ James Tonner, who owns land at Black Johnson with his mother, Jane Aspden Gbandewa, has written an open letter to the President of Sierra Leone, calling for him to intervene and stop the construction of the fishing port, which Tonner said would be ‘disastrous for the country and the planet’. In August 2021, a spokesperson for China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs made the following public remarks about the project: ‘The Sierra Leonean government and industry associations, as well as various sectors of society, have repeatedly clarified and expressed support for the project in Sierra Leone, which the parliament recently approved. The remarks of people from all walks of life in Sierra Leone clearly show that the construction of a modern fishing [harbor] has been the long-cherished wish of the Sierra Leonean people since the 1970s. The construction of the fishing [harbor] will significantly improve Sierra Leone's fishing infrastructure. On the issue of environmental assessment and land requisition, the government of Sierra Leone has pointed out that the siting of the project is the most appropriate arrangement based on considerations of multiple factors including the water depth and the environment. The Sierra Leonean side has commissioned a professional institution to conduct an environmental assessment and earmarked funds for compensation for the local landowners. According to the registration records of Sierra Leone's fishery authorities, there are now more than 100 industrial fishing vessels from 16 countries and regions operating in Sierra Leone. The completion of the fishing [harbor] will benefit not only the local people, but also the relevant enterprises operating in Sierra Leone. It is a win-win project for all parties. So the claims in this article about the fishmeal plant, destruction of surrounding rainforest, disregard for the local people, China hoovering up resources, are all untrue and untenable.’ As of January 2022, there was still no evidence that project implementation had commenced.",Pipeline: Commitment,Development,Grant,Yes,ODA-like,China Ministry of Commerce,,Government of Sierra Leone|Sierra Leone Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation,Zhejiang Communications Construction Group Co Ltd,,73629006.93,8.27212276,-13.16756,,approximate location

Ltd (CHEC) signed a deferred payment ('延期付款”) agreement for the Extension and Dredging Works of Berths 17 and 18 at Port Sudan Project. The loan carried an 8-year maturity and the borrower (SPC) was expected to make monthly repayments with the retained (ring-fenced) portion of its monthly operating income. The other borrowing terms of the loan are unknown. However, is is known that SPC used the deferred payment arrangement to finance a $110 million commercial (EPC) contract that it signed with China Harbour Engineering Co. Ltd on June 8, 2006.The purpose of the project was to construct two 70,000-ton (TEU) container terminals at Port Sudan (Berths 17 and 18). The total length of the terminals is 781 meters with a water depth of 16 meters. The project scope also included dredging activities (for a foundation trench, turning basin, main channel) with a total volume of 3.5 million cubic meters. CHEC was the contractor responsible for implementation.Project implementation commenced in January 2007. The project was originally expected to reach completion within 30 months (July 2009). As of December 2009, construction of the main terminals and ancillary works were complete, but site cleaning activities had not yet been undertaken. The project was ultimately completed in February 2011. An official project completion ceremony was held on December 21, 2011.However, the deferred payment (lending) arrangement between SPC and CHEC appears to have underperformed vis-à-vis the original expectations of CHEC. Sudan’s Ministry of Finance initially set up a special bank account into which SPC deposited its monthly operating income (worth approximately $200 million a year), and SPC was allowed to retain some but not all of these funds for its own purposes (such as construction and maintenance of port facilities and servicing its debts to CHEC). However, Sudan’s Ministry of Finance subsequently took away SPC’s ability to retain a portion of its monthly income around 2011 (when the Sudanese Government faced an acute foreign exchange shortage), which made it substantially more difficult for SPC to honor its monthly repayment obligations.
